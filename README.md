Small node.js script that checks various sources if vaccination appointments are available. If so, immediately opens a browser window for you so you can book quickly.

Currently its configured to check all known sources and vaccines. If you want to fine tune which vaccines you looks for, what sources you search, or which shot you need, [please change your config accordingly](https://github.com/Pita/berlin-vac-appointment-checker/tree/main/src/config.ts)
